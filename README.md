5) Car rental software
   
You are going to create a desktop application for car rental companies. The software will be
used by the store workers. Workers can make reservations, make a checkout for
reservation. He can add fines to a car which is returned to the store for smoking/ damage/
empty tank etc. Sometimes some cars may be out of office because it is being used by
another customer or they may be in maintenance service. The worker will create a
report/receipt for the car when it is returned by the customer. You will not need to add a
payment system. The cars can be taken from a store and can be dropped to another one.
If you are going to make a web application, you will need to add a user login system so that
customers can also make reservations to the cars.
